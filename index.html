                    01 There was a scientist and his lab. He has been conducting experiments since he was 6. Birds with human voices, octopuses with human hands, cats that always land on their back, you name it. But there was one animal that was not affected by any formulas. Then the scientist came up with IDC. First 5 formulas did not work well, but the 6th was the one. Ducks on IDC-6 were showing signs on intelligence. They were able to solve puzzles, pre-school math equations and memory exercises. However, nothing lasts forever, and the scientist had to escape the country to avoid jailtime for illegal experiments with primates. 
                    The experiment was never stopped, and first few ducks started studying IDC-6 to cook more of it. About 6700 dozes were made before the lab was abandoned. Soon after, a drug dealer named Ty bought the lab, took the first dose and turned into a duck. He shared a few more doses with his friends, and they turned into ducks as well. The formula was lost, so the remaining 6666 pills have to be distributed with caution.

We don't want to do that, but we can't launch the project just by telling everyone to buy some NFT's.

                            <p class="oneBlock_left__text two">Speaking of, we want everyone to find a place where they can feel at home. Meaningful conversations, connections and friendship instead of grinding and "wen this" questions. We want everyone to find a place where they can develop their skills, and we will achieve that by "splitting" the community in 6 parts, according to the factions. If you're a degen, you can discuss the next project to ape in with other degens, if you're a developer, you can always ask for an advice from someone more experienced than you. In short: find friends and build together. Ducks Together Strong!

Our apparel has to be something that any person would wear without feeling cringey. We've come up with a unique way to customize apparel, it's easy and elegant. Merch plays an important part of our project, as it will be the main source of income. </p>
